# About
A collection of data structures using C++ templates.

# Usage
Program files are kept within the _main_ branch.

All classes are kept within the __AbstractLists.h__ file in the namespace __adscol__, to be included within the program. All currently implemented structures are written at the top of the file.

The __Source.cpp__ file contains working tests for most/all methods for each data structure.

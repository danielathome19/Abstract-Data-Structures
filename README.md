#About
A collection of data structures using C++ templates.

Most data structures are based off of linked lists for educational purposes; rather than arrays. 

_These will be modified later on to be either included with headers such as LinkedListQueue/ArrayQueue, or implemented with interfaces._

#Usage
Program files are kept within the _main_ branch.

All classes are kept within the __AbstractLists.h__ file, to be included within the program. All currently implemented structures are written at the top of the file.

The __Source.cpp__ file contains working tests for most/all methods for each data structure.

#Bugs/Features
Bugs are tracked using Github Issue tracker system.

Please use issue tracker for following purpose:
  * to raise a bug request; do include specific details and label it appropriately.
  * to suggest any improvements in existing features.
  * to suggest new features or structures or applications.

#License
The code is licensed under MIT License.
